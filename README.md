# Working Together in the Pharmacy

#### Promoting Practice Readiness to Full Scope
These interactive virtual case-based scenarios were designed to simulate real-world pharmacy practice. Developed with a focus on intra-professional role understanding and collaborative practice, these modules aim to help secondary and post-secondary students gain a better understanding of the roles and responsibilities of pharmacy technicians and pharmacists. 

Technology Stack
